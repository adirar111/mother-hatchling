        "I am a 21-year-old non-binary artist and filmmaker from Edmonton, Alberta. My mom was a dietician, and my dad worked as a high school guidance counselor in the neighboring small town of Stony Plain. Before moving to Vancouver for UBC, I had lived my entire life in the same house, with the same bedroom on the city's outskirts. My life was drenched in middle-class suburbia, and my alienation to the rest of the world. I struggled heavily with my identity as I grew up, wrestling with my estrangement from the rest of my family, and with my gender and sexuality existing in opposition to my French-Catholic schooling. Having reached a breaking point at the age of sixteen, I ended up making my first film, rather than killing myself. I have since discovered a depth of love for my life and the people who populate it, that I had never ever thought would be possible.",

      aboutArtwork: [
        "My mom, Holly Ames, died suddenly in front of me three days before I moved to Vancouver. Me, My sister and my dad drove fourteen hours in a state of medical shock to get me here, and then they left. And I was alone with the most traumatic memories I have ever acquired in my life. My first year was nothing but a constant disassociation. I just remember being so, so, so confused. I made FLYMAN in collaboration with my roommate, creative partner and best friend Skylar Somnus, over the course of the following year as a kind of self-portrait to illustrate my experience. The film was originally supposed to have dialogue, but after my mom passed I realize how futile it was to try to communicate the pain I was in with words alone, so I settled on this medium. The film was completed, and released in August of 2022, the same month in which Holly had passed away a year prior. It would not have been possible without Skylar's understanding and dedication to me as the bearer of my grief on-screen as the central protagonist of the film, as well as off-screen as the true love of my life at the time.",
        "Every person involved with the production was attuned to my grief and kept me company as I was dragged through the pits of it, and I could never be grateful enough. One specific shoot day nearly actually killed me, and I can tell the story of that later on, but that experience led me to so many conclusions about myself, my mother, the afterlife, my love, and made it possible for me to be a peace with my mom's passing. I haven't achieved that peace completely yet, but believe me, it truly is possible.",

      aboutArtwork: [
        "I moved here from Alberta where I was born and raised 5 years ago. Being away from family was particularly difficult during the pandemic when distance felt magnified and time distorted. During that time, my mother’s mother became really ill. My grandma and I were really close, so it was difficult to know she was living out her final months in a hospice and I couldn’t say goodbye. My mom would visit my grandma everyday, and I felt like I was grieving vicariously through her. It was a slow going, and I experienced a sensation of unravelling, at times feeling tightly wound, and other moments like I have to let go. This piece became a meditation on grief as I processed my emotions.",

This material symbolizes the connection we share, and the many strengths and weaknesses that were passed down from my grandma to my mom, and my mom to me. By positioning the spool in the centre of a canvas, the frame becomes a window or portal, the spoon on the precipice of sadness with a backdrop of layered grid lines that offer an imperfect container.",

      aboutArtists: [
        "Hello, I'm Zyrell! I am a second year psychology major and law & society minor. As a child I watched my dad draw a lot, but never got interested in it until middle school. Through the persuasion of others, who constantly told me I had a knack for art, I worked to improve my skills through watching videos and constant practising. In high school, I found love in graphic design, and continued to expand my world of art by exploring different mediums. I fell in love with acrylics, then watercolours, gouache and inks. I dreamed of an art and creatives related career, but often didn't feel like it was an acceptable choice to make. So, I focused on academics, and declined an opportunity to follow a graphic design career path proposed to me by my high school graphics teacher, who was always so supportive of my art. Instead, I applied to UBC and got in, continuing on to further my academic education. Upon arriving, in my first semester of my first year, I took contemporary art and was blessed to have a supportive TA who encouraged my work and believed in everything I was putting forward even though I didn't myself. He was adamant that my art was important. Even so, I majored in psychology with my mind set on law school after my bachelors. After the only art course I've taken at UBC, I have not taken another since (I had not been able to get into a class) and worked on my major and minor instead. Since then, art has become less of a constant in my life, with my materials and paintings going untouched and unfinished. It's a little embarrassing to say when I'm submitting a piece for this, but I've barely drawn and have instead been in massive periods of art block for the last year or so. However, when I saw this artist's call, I saw it as an opportunity to find my creative side again! I'm glad to have tried it, for all that it's worth.",

      aboutArtwork: [
        "Originally, this piece was titled \"in your arms\" to highlight the aspect of intimacy and closeness that mothers and children have. My work depicts longing for that intimacy. I found it funny to have an individual, depicted as looking through the hole, yearn to be a mouse just because this mouse is loved and cared for by their mother. It answers the question: What would make someone want to be a mouse? Mice which are generally considered dirty pests, which have a reputation of carrying diseases, are surely not something someone wants to be. Yet despite all this, the mouse is loved. This portrays a narrative that you can have everything, be everything, and still lack something essential to our being–a mother's love. As is seen, the individual does not fit through this hole that leads to a scene of care, illustrating how they may have outgrown this \"love of a mother.\" When I was younger, I felt that I was much closer to my mom, and felt more needed and loved. It was me and her against the world. However, as I got older, I felt myself drifting from her, and as I grew into myself, I felt that I grew out of that space between her arms. Her love seemed to fit a child that I was not anymore. My mom and I had a lot of disagreements and many back-and-forth’s. I admit I was not the kindest at times, but for years I felt cheated out of a relationship with my mother that I had seen with others around me. I changed the title last minute to instead allude to what isn't seen in the work. Behind the mice is the individual who longed to be them, but behind the individual is the love they haven't seen yet. The individual is too focused on what they have lost, to realize what's around them. The hole depicts a tunnel, sort of like having tunnel-vision. My mom's relationship and I have improved greatly over the years, as I've come to realize that I was too focused on the past I've experienced to appreciate the love that I was experiencing. Of course, it was different from when I was 5, but at 15 I hadn't realized that love evolves with you. Nearly 20 now and I know that my mother was always behind me, supporting me, and loving me like she always has. I was not a mouse and will never be a mouse, so why was I so focused on what was instead of what is? ",

        "This piece came from my then strained relationship with my mother. It is based on a photo of my mother holding me as a baby. When I first saw the photo only a few years ago, it hit me really hard. I remember crying when I first saw it. The look on her face in the photo was profoundly empty, my face was away from the camera. I wondered how she felt when that photo was taken; if she loved me or if she was struggling to be a mother to me. The feeling I got from this photo was deeply tied to the overall feelings about my difficult relationship with her growing up and how it affected me into adulthood. The carvings and prints I made in this reductive series acted as a sort of physical transmutation of my feelings towards her as a carer to me in the past, my challenging and lonely upbringing, and over time coming to sympathize with her experience as a person with generational trauma, grief, and her own sets of challenges.",

        "My other family members comment on it quite a bit how similar we are in terms of personality and temperament. It's been a blessing and a curse at times, depending on when during my life you would ask me. We're both very quiet but strong individuals, she passed down to me our shared maternal traits of stubbornness, devotion, sensitivity, and an intense love. Because of our similarities, we understand each other on a very abstract, ethereal way - but at the very same time our resemblance spawns a lot of tension, stubbornness, and volatile emotions.",
        "Our parallels also extend from our personalities to our bodily circumstances. Our relationship was taken to another level when she had breast cancer. Later on, I found a lump in my own breast. (We both turned out okay!). We slowly started to realize all the other things we had in common: depression, mania, (a warped concept of) femininity, etc. At that point, it wasn't just our minds and temperaments that were parallel but also our bodies. I was able to tap into a kind of empathy and connection that only my mother and I shared.",
        "I was interested not only in our relationship, but also other hereditary relationships that have informed the environment of ours. At the time I made this work, I was living with both my mom and my grandma (her mom), and so there were many thoughts running through my head about our lineage, how my mom's relationality with her mom has informed mine, and how my mom and I's relationship will inform my possible future daughters. I wanted to explore in particular, the parallels between childhood and motherhood, and I did so by exploring my own memories and talking with my mom.",
        "The work is meant to capture some of my own perspectives on motherhood, but more notably how my experiences meshes with and is informed by my mother's childhood and life. I also want to mention the somewhat quiet vitality of my grandmother in this work. She has alzheimer’s and a complex, spirited relationship with my mother, and so it was their relationship that sparked questions of intergenerational trauma and memory. In this work, I question my own ideas of memories (or the loss of it), genetic inheritance, legacy, and motherhood.",

        "My first work is a still life about my childhood. It uses three dried roses to symbolize a childhood cut short, imagery common in 18th and 19th century. They are balanced delicately on a full glass of sherry. The portrait of Mary and Jesus is a similarly old print, and was a very common sight at the turn of the last century (If you pay attention interior photographs from the period, you’ll probably find one or two). The religiosity I grew up under continues in the old prayer book, with cheerios dropped around to remind the viewer once more of the theme of childhood.",
        "My second work is a self-portrait as a bride. I made it at a time of constant “phototherapy”—reenacting scenes of trauma in front of the camera to document the experience on my own terms. I was madly heartbroken, suffering daily with PTSD that would not let up until I eventually moved halfway across the United States. Looking back after significant healing, I’m struck that the image has changed meaning for me. It is no longer about playing bride to my once beloved but the deeper, more tangled and more ancient rite of womanhood. My mother went crazy and left when I was 8 years old; I never knew her as a functioning person. I sometimes ask my father and surrounding family members “what was she like?” because she must have been normal enough to marry and have two children with, right? And I don’t know who that is.",
        "So the images of my mother at her wedding are hypnotic: she was prettiest at her wedding, wasn’t she? Every woman I know is. It is when we are the youngest and the thinnest we will ever be, before we let the men who bought us open our legs to make their children, to grow old and fat and used. The wedding photos are the ones our children (and grandchildren (like me) will cherish, the black and white chemicals we let ourselves be poisoned by. More than anything though, I suppose, is that in these images I can imagine a world where she is capable of taking care of me.",
        "I raised my sister (and still do, to this day). I struggle with the decision to have children from the memory of that responsibility. I value family but fear the corruption of my body in the act. Puberty was traumatic for me, and the idea of my body growing another makes me physically sick. Getting married is the first part of that equation most of the time. I am tired of seeing couples marry only to have a kid a few years later. I can’t be that predictable. But these things are usually larger than yourself, and I grew up in a large Mexican-American family where these bonds are akin to God. I wish I didn’t want to be a mother, nor have the deep desire to raise a child in a large extended family like I did. In these moments I wish God had made me a man. Things would be so much easier, wouldn’t it?",

        "My mother was very \"motherly\" until around the age of 7. There had always been signs of her being a bit off, but it ultimately culminated in her developing a deep alcohol dependency and all the horrible side effects of that. I watched several times what I believed was my mother's death from seizures, wishing desperately to be my younger sister who would have no memory of it, her being aged 2 at the time. She had always been a stay at home mom, which meant I knew her and depended on her very intimately. For around a year and half during this I took care of her (and my sister), believing I could fix her. Ultimately, my father divorced her. At the time I did not understand it fully. I only knew one day I came home from my grandparent's and she was not home. She never did return. I blamed my father for ousting her for many years, but I've come to realize he was protecting us from her. She was incredibly erratic and would not accept the help she needed. I remember her outbursts, physically and mentally, but was not aware of the full extent of danger she routinely but us in—while I remember her taking us out at night to lone parks, begging her to take us home, I did not realize she did so to drink from her hidden vodka bottles, nor did I understand that my baby sister's sunburns were from my mother drinking herself to sleep on the beach's benches while my sister roamed free. I have not lived with her since the age of 8, and it has been a very long (and in many ways infinite) journey of healing. A few years after she met and married a man in Canada, and has been living here on an expired visa for many years. In many ways her husband is horrible, but he keeps her stable. She's hasn't been allowed outside for years, but from his iron fist she also isn't able to get the drugs and alcohol nor spend her money like crazy as I saw growing up. It's difficult to pick apart the existence of the chronically abused woman who simply knows no other way of life. I used to joke my mother was the woman at the gas station who ended up dead in a ditch; that's not true anymore. I speak with her a handful of times a year and in the past year or so it has become much easier. After spending so much time with both my younger sister and my partner with autism, I realized that she most likely has autism as well. After coming to that conclusion, I can speak to her with more grace and tact. I used to get very mad and her \"craziness\" and blame the alcohol and traumatic brain injuries—but much of it can be explained with this new revelation. I will always be upset and hurt for the trauma she made me endure at such a young age, but I have come to find peace in realizing she is not my \"mom.\" Looking back she never was, and the source of my pain was always looking for my \"mom\" when every other girl had such a bright and shining (and functioning) one. Getting older has been a blessing. I looked forward to it since I was that scared child of 7. Being an adult is liberating, and I would never change it for the world. My childhood was horrible, and continuously predicated on the whims of others. As an adult I am in charge. I can physically /leave/ people that terrify me. I didn't have that choice as a child. I always tell younger people it gets better, because it does. I hated childhood, and I don't reminisce seriously. Being an adult means having all the freedom in the world. I love it. I wish I could take care of little me in the past and tell her how awesome life gets, but that your past isn't always a curse either. I function quite normally (after a lot, but still) and I don't think about my childhood except when made to. I used to wish my childhood never happened, but I don't anymore. It made me unbelievable resilient and remarkably empathetic. I am my own mother and my own mom, and it honestly rocks.",

      aboutArtwork: [
        "This project was one of the few things that made me feel good about myself this term. I was proud of how it turned out, especially after showing it to class and hearing people’s reactions.",
        "I doubted myself when I was making this video because I thought it was too personal, and I was worried that it would make other people feel uncomfortable. I still don’t feel too confident that it wouldn’t. The worst part about making vulnerable art is 1) you get scared of people judging you for what they found out about you, and 2) it’s giving too much information that no one asked for 3) people say it’s good because they are scared to judge vulnerable art.",
        "During the critique, when I heard from a few people that they almost teared up, I was very surprised. It was a good day and I felt like I proved myself that I can make artworks I have always hoped to make. This project brought me one step closer to the kind of art I want to make, which is, an artwork that is deeply meaningful to me but also one that would be relevant and interesting to others.",
        "For this video, I drew inspiration from Alison Bechdel and her autobiographical graphic novels. I was able to learn about myself through reading about her life. I was also inspired by the Netflix show “The Midnight Gospel”, especially the aesthetics of it. And lastly, Sophie Calle’s film Double Blind/No Sex Last Night, in which the artist made the film very personal, vulnerable, and humorous.",
        "I hope this video is the first one to my series, “Navigating Through My Emotions”. After I got with my girlfriend, I realized more than ever that I have to learn to process and express my emotions better. I have a habit of keeping bad feelings to myself until it oozes out of my body and eventually bursts. It takes me a day or two to tell my partner an occurrence from school that made me feel bad about myself. Even when Danielle asks, I can only talk if I find the perfect time and environment to feel safe to be vulnerable. I’m extremely scared of getting hurt and therefore being open to others, so it’s funny that the kind of art I want to make is something personal and vulnerable.",
