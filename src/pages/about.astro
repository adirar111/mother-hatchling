  <h2>Co-curated by Bofei Zhang</h2>
  <h2>Website developed by Aymen Dirar</h2>

    "Ode to Mom" is the second of the "ode to" exhibition series. <a
      href="https://sunnypork.com/"
      target="_blank">Sunny</a
    > came up with the idea as she was working as a Hatch Gallery director at UBC.
    She formed a team with two dear friends, <a
      href="https://www.instagram.com/bbooffeeiizzhhaanngg/"
      target="_blank">Bofei</a
    >, who she met in Kellyâ€™s visual art studio class, and <a
      href="http://adirar111.github.io"
      target="_blank">Aymen</a
    >, who is a computer science major who she met through her good friend
    Braxton. The three of them worked together to make this online exhibition
    possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aymen coded the website from scratch all by himself and Bofei helped out in
    all aspects of the exhibition organizing. The first one of the "ode to"
    exhibition series was "An Ode to My Younger Self". It was a physical
    exhibition in the Hatch Gallery curated by Sunny featuring 12 student
    artists.
